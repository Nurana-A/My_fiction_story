# Surprise





I had always thought with a quiet sense of regret about children whose parents were both born and raised in a big city. Poor things — from the very beginning, they were denied the right to an entire world: magical, like a fairy tale, and so alive — the very world called “at grandma’s village.”



My paternal grandmother lived in Akstafa, a small provincial town about five hundred kilometers from Baku. It was convenient to get there by train.. My parents were busy with work, so most often I traveled with my aunt or one of my many relatives.



The magic began long before arriving in the village — it began right at the station. A huge hall with a high ceiling, the smell of iron and suitcases, the hum of voices, departure announcements — all of it was not just a backdrop but a gateway to another, fairy-tale world. Standing on the platform, I felt like a character from Harry Potter, as if I were about to step onto Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. The very anticipation of the train filled my heart with joy and excitement — ahead lay the journey to summer, to my grandmother, to quiet but adventure-filled days.



And then — the whistle. As if on cue, my heart tightened. Its long, slightly melancholic sound seemed to echo within me: the train was leaving, and with it, I was moving farther from the city and closer to the real place where the air smelled of freshly cut grass, where fireflies danced above the garden in the evenings, and where my grandmother would greet me at the gate with a smile and warm bread in her hands.



The platform was always crowded and noisy — as if the city itself, unwilling to let go of its children, had come to see them off. The bustle, voices, shouting, the clinking of bottles and baby carriages — everything blended into a colorful, lively orchestra. Everywhere were passengers with duffel bags, carts loaded with shopping bags, baskets of food, and children’s backpacks. Gypsy women — constant companions of station life — huddled in corners with children clinging to them like chicks to a hen. Their voices were high and slightly anxious, as if trying to outshout fate itself.



The station’s highlights were the kiosks, full of bright wrappers, squat bottles of mineral water like “Badamly” and “Borjomi,” and sodas with poetic names — “Kyzyl Gül,” “Duchess,” “Tarragon.” Particularly tempting were the flat sesame cookies — fragrant, warm, as if just baked.



I listened with bated breath to the station announcements about arrivals and departures. When the strict, clipped voices echoed through the loudspeakers — as if the old, reliable system itself were speaking — it felt like a passage into another dimension: “Train number such-and-such, bound for such-and-such station, departs from track three…”



Finally, our train was announced. A powerful rumble sounded, and from afar appeared a huge clattering “beast” speeding toward us, vibrating with all its carriages, like a great creature hungry for the road. The crowd surged forward. We grabbed our bags and ran along the train, searching for our carriage — this dash along the platform with heavy luggage was a ritual, without which summer never truly began.



Every carriage had conductors and conductresses — strict, confident, standing in command. They quickly checked tickets, nodded slightly, and let us into the train. Finally, we reached our door. I struggled up the high metal steps, feeling the faint tremor of the iron beneath my feet, squeezed through the narrow corridor with our luggage, and entered the compartment.



It was small and cozy, carrying that distinctive smell of burnt rubber. We arranged our things, spread out the bags, and sat on the soft seats, waiting. Passengers moved constantly outside our compartment. Faces of those seeing us off flickered past, some laughing, some wiping away tears secretly. Then — a whistle. Piercing, commanding. A sudden jolt. The train lurched, creaking, reluctantly but inevitably starting its journey. The wheels began to beat a rhythm: tuk-tuk, tuk-tuk… First slow, then faster, overlapping in a chaotic harmony.



And then — we were on our way. Outside the window, the city slowly drifted away, replaced by landscapes — first dusty outskirts, then endless steppes. Occasionally, tiny villages appeared, like in a picture, with sparse lights in the windows. Houses, posts, trees raced past, and finally, moonlit fields flashed by.



I adored that indescribable, cozy atmosphere of the train, which could not be found anywhere else. The dim ceiling lights, the swaying curtains, narrow shelves, the muffled conversations of neighbors, and — as the climax — the appearance of the conductor. In his uniform, with the ever-present folder in hand, he brought hot, strong tea — in thin glass cups set in dim, time-darkened metal holders. Steam rose from the cups, carrying the aroma of black tea with a faint hint of railway romance.



Sugar came with the tea — real, hard, wrapped neatly in branded paper featuring a train fading into the distance.



I loved that unhurried tea ritual — to the steady, lulling rhythm of the wheels, to the mesmerizing dance of lights outside. Everything felt both grown-up, important, and yet magical. It was a time when no one hurried, when you could simply exist, look out the window, and dream.



Then came night. The window slightly open, half-light in the compartment, warm wind on my face smelling of metal, dust, and wormwood. I covered myself with a sheet, listening to the creaking of the walls and the rumble of wheels below, and fell asleep — peacefully, sweetly, as if the train was carrying me not only to a geographical place but into the realm of childhood dreams.



In the morning, everything started with noise. A knock at the door, the loud, cheerful voice of the conductor, slightly hoarse from long journeys:



— The train will soon arrive in Ganja! Ganja!



For me, the stretch between Ganja and Akstafa was always the longest and most agonizing. Time seemed to thicken, every minute stretched like thick honey. I peered out the window, hoping to catch a glimpse of familiar sights, but fields, hills, and forest strips stretched endlessly around.



Then — familiar outlines. A sign with the name. My heart leapt. The train slowed, creaking, nudging forward in anticipation. And finally — the last whistle, the deceleration, the jolt. We had arrived.



Akstafa station. My summer starting point. A place where everything changed: the air, the time, myself. My heart — like a bird — soared upward. I was home.



In Akstafa, we had a two-story house — sturdy, old, as if it held all our family chronicles. From the yard, a wooden staircase led up, which I always climbed as if ascending into a fairy tale. Upstairs, a terrace opened — wide, draped with roses, with carved railings through which the garden peeked. This was the terrace where the doors of home — to grandmother — opened.



She always greeted us with a special, unique light in her eyes — a joy untainted by fatigue, no matter how busy she had been. Her “bread and salt” was the thinnest lavash rolled with tender, slightly salty village cheese — a taste impossible to forget. This was always followed by tea brewed in a wood-fired samovar. Smoke rose in lazy rings, filling the terrace with the rich, tangy scent of wood and herbs.



A heavy metal sugar bowl with decorative legs stood on the table, and tea was poured into red polka-dotted cups — “cute,” as I called them. Light, resonant, and somehow the tea tasted best from them. Jam accompanied the tea — usually apricot or cherry, amber-colored, slightly thick, as if sunlight was hidden within.



But even this paradise on the terrace could not hold me for long. The garden — alive, blooming, slightly wild — beckoned. I would run down the creaking stairs, pass the plums, pomegranates, apricots, and inevitably pick roses. They grew in corners — red, pink, peach. But I loved the white ones most. Their scent was almost imperceptible, like the breath of morning. I gathered them into a bouquet, placed them in water, and sat nearby, simply inhaling. It was my personal ritual, my way of being alone with summer.



As the sun dipped toward sunset, and coolness filled the house, I moved to the dining room. There, on the wall, hung my favorite painting — a still life with a huge bouquet of wildflowers. I would lie on the rug for hours, watching it. With every glance, the bouquet seemed to change: a tiny daisy would appear, a lilac clover, or a fluffy wormwood sprig. I lost myself in the bouquet as if in a forest, hiding from all worries, becoming part of the painting itself.



The most magical hours, however, were in the evenings. When the heat subsided and a thin smoke rose above the village from fires, grandmother began her quiet reception of guests. Neighbors, cousins, uncles, acquaintances — all came to sit, talk, and share. We sat on the terrace, listening for the familiar knock on the stairs, trying to guess whose footsteps they were.



Around the round wooden table, covered with a linen cloth, slow conversations unfolded. Grandmother set the samovar and began brewing her famous healing tea. She took a pouch of dried flowers — yarrow, mint, St. John’s wort, chamomile, sage, rose petals, thyme. She mixed them by eye, as if inspired, and every cup was unique.



As the samovar puffed, aromas rose that defied description. The warm haze carried the scents of fire, herbs, evening air, and old wood. They enveloped us like a soft blanket. We drank tea, and no one was in a hurry. Time seemed to stop — if only for one evening, so we could remember: this was real life.

One warm, fragrant evening in May, when I was nine, and the air was already filled with the scent of blooming gardens and still-moist earth after watering, Uncle Akper — my father’s cousin — peeked onto our terrace. My father had always said he had been quite a handsome man in his youth. Dark-haired, dark-eyed, he truly looked like a striking Eastern man, and girls would lose their heads at a single glance. Even now, with streaks of gray at his temples, he looked like a film hero — always neat, reserved, slightly mysterious. He had three daughters. With him was his middle daughter, green-eyed with light-brown hair — my age and my friend, Gunesh.



We all sat at the familiar round table on the terrace. The samovar had begun to hiss quietly, aromatic steam rising from its spout. Grandmother poured tea into those red polka-dotted cups, placed jam, dried apricots, and fresh cheese on the table. Everything was as usual — and yet it felt like something was about to happen. I noticed Uncle Akper glancing at me briefly, then leaning toward grandmother to say something quietly. Grandmother listened, nodding slightly, and smiled mysteriously, as if they were sharing some magical secret in which I, somehow, was a key participant.



When the tea was finished and the samovar quieted, Uncle Akper leaned back in his chair, looked at Gunesh and me, and said loudly, as if casually:



— Well, girls, tomorrow I’ll take you to a very interesting place. A surprise awaits you… a special one.



Gunesh and I straightened up instantly. My heart fluttered — it was filled with impatient curiosity.



— Where? — I blurted, unable to contain myself.



Uncle Akper squinted mischievously and added, as if it didn’t matter:



— That’s a secret for now. But if you want, you can spend the night at our place. Tomorrow morning, a car will pick us up, and we’ll go. All together.



From that moment, Gunesh and I lost all peace, bombarding him with questions, trying to guess: maybe a lake? Or a trip to the forest? But Uncle Akper was steadfast, like a rock. He smiled, shrugged, and only fueled our imagination.



— Don’t even try. Don’t even think — I won’t tell, — he laughed, finishing his tea.



We didn’t give up, but then grandmother intervened. She had been watching our animated assault silently all this time. Finally, she spoke:



— I don’t really know either… But as I understand it, something magical awaits you. And if you find out too early, — she glanced at us meaningfully — all the magic might disappear. Why would you want that?



Gunesh and I exchanged glances. Her words affected us more than any prohibition. After all, we believed in miracles. And if grandmother — the wisest of all women — spoke of magic, it meant it was serious. So, we had to wait. Patience — the key to any magic.



We fell silent obediently. Yet inside, anticipation boiled. The night seemed the longest of my life, yet it passed surprisingly quickly.



I always enjoyed visiting Gunesh. Her house and yard were always full of children, and we could play all sorts of games. But that night we went straight to sleep; it was late, and we had to get up at the crack of dawn, before the first roosters crowed. Gyunesh’s mother was visiting Baku with her other daughters.



Morning came still dark, and Uncle Akper woke us. The weather was wonderful. Dawn brought a faint chill from the gardens, birds just beginning to call to each other. I was on my feet, ready for the unknown.



We were thrilled at the prospect of our mysterious outing. The car was supposed to arrive any minute, so we went outside to wait.



— Ready? — asked Uncle Akper, looking toward the approaching small truck.



Gunesh and I nodded in unison, anticipating the secret.



Then, around the corner, appeared a small truck with an open bed. It bounced happily over bumps, headlights slicing through the gloom. We tensed: was this our magical journey? The truck stopped at the gate, and loud laughter came from the back. Gunesh and I exchanged astonished glances: five or six boys and girls were already there — just like us, some with braided hair, some wearing sunhats, some with backpacks. Everyone was beaming, as if they knew something important.



We were lifted easily into the truck bed, helped to settle among the other kids. And off we went together, wind whipping our faces, toward our surprise.



The wooden seats were slightly slippery, and every jolt tossed us like balls. We clung to each other, squealed, laughed, and shouted — it was thrillingly fun, almost like a ride at an amusement park, only freer and more alive. The wind tangled our hair, tickled our ears.



In the cabin, uncle Akper sat beside the driver. We still didn’t know where we were going, but it didn’t matter. The journey itself was wonderful — bumps, dusty paths, barking village dogs, poplars flashing past, blue sky above, the smell of steppe grass wrapping around us like a warm blanket.



Half an hour passed unnoticed. Dawn was barely breaking. Smiles never left our faces. Our hearts raced in anticipation.



The truck rounded a large hill and stopped. We looked around and saw the sunrise over a field of unusual beauty. At first, it seemed the sky and the land were glowing red. Then, as uncle Akper and the driver helped the children down and we all approached the field, it became clear: we were facing a breathtaking poppy field. I had never seen such a mesmerizing sight — sky and earth merged, pulsating in red, as if the entire field were part of the magical phenomenon of sunrise.



The scarlet poppies, fluttering , greeted the first sunbeams — the most unexpected surprise for all of us. In that moment, it felt as if even the breath stopped so as not to disturb the perfection. The poppies swayed gently in the morning breeze, dancing their morning dance, sunlight softly resting on their petals, turning each bloom into a living, flaming fire. We stood at the edge of this scarlet sea, hesitant to step forward, as if afraid to break the spell.



At first, we stood stunned by the magic, and then, when the full light of day revealed everything, someone — Gunesh or one of the boys — broke free, running forward with a cry full of joy. As if on cue, we all — like a flock of birds — rushed after, plunging barefoot into the crimson sea of swaying poppies — across morning grass, petals, and warm, damp earth. We ran, twirled, fell into the grass, laughed, screamed, gathered armfuls of poppies, wove wreaths, threw petals — it was not just a game. It was true magic, into which we stumbled by happy accident, as if stepping through a door open for one single dawn.



Uncle Akper leaned against the truck, smiling. His eyes sparkled with pleasure. He neither called us, hurried us, nor limited our time — as if he knew this moment had to remain with us forever. He was happy because he had made us happy. At the time, I might not have fully understood it — but now I know for certain: such gifts are never forgotten.



Many years have passed since that unforgettable moment. Uncle Akper is no longer with us, but the poppy sunrise he once gave me lives on — inside me.



Now I live in Houston, Texas. In our city, poppies bloom in various colors: yellow, white, orange. But not the classic red. A year ago, in May, I found a photo online of a field of red poppies on a farm three hours from our home. I called them excitedly. A woman answered:



“Can I come see the poppy field?” I asked.



With regret in her voice, she said I was too late — the poppy bloom happens at the end of March and lasts only a week. “Come next year! Check our website for updates on the bloom stages,” she added.



I have waited a year for the poppies to bloom. March arrives. I check the website, which posts updates. Finally, the first notice! A photo of a single poppy in a vast green field, captioned: “The first poppy has appeared… soon there will be two… and finally — the entire field of poppies!”



Three days later, the country went into coronavirus lockdown.



We stayed home. I kept checking the site; the single poppy remained. I called again. The woman answered:



“The whole field is in bloom. The view is incredibly beautiful. But, unfortunately, we are closed for quarantine.”



Before me was still the same unchanging photo of one solitary poppy in the vast field, bowing its head, looking at me with love… I pressed play on the song Lalələr (“Poppies”) by Rashid Beybutov and listened… listened…

At the beginning of spring, on the plains of Ganja,

The poppies have bloomed again…



Poppies, poppies,

Poppies, poppies,



From my dreams, what visions have passed,

From my dreams, what visions have passed.



At the beginning of summer, on the Ganja plains,

The red poppies have bloomed again…



Red poppies, red poppies,

Like dreams, phantasms in the half-light,

Like dreams, phantasms in the half-light.
