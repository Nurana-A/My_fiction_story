The Pomegranate Tree



I never believed in miracles. I thought they were fantasies for the gullible—something like fairy tales people tell each other on long evenings, when all they want is a little comfort and a glimmer of hope. And if it hadn’t happened to me, I suppose I would’ve doubted it too. I would’ve thought: just another tall tale.



But it all happened in real life—in Houston, the southern American city we moved to from Baku fifteen years ago. In that noisy, heat-hazed place, I suddenly felt something strange—as if the past had briefly tapped me on the shoulder.



In some ways, Houston reminded me of Baku—maybe because of the blazing southern sun that melts the asphalt, or the heavy magnolia leaves that are everywhere here. But even more so, it was the multicultural atmosphere. Just like in the old days in Baku, where Azerbaijanis, Russians, Jews, Armenians, Lezgins, Georgians, and Tatars lived side by side, so here too, on the other side of the world, in a single neighborhood lived Texans, Latin Americans, African Americans, Indians, Pakistanis, Chinese, Arabs…

Yet the ocean between us wasn’t only geographical. It divided memory, scents, language—even the landscape. Everything felt… not quite right. And though I tried to put down roots, every curve in the road, every branch on a tree, even the sound of the rain whispered to me: you are from another world.



So, in those early years, nostalgia settled deep within me. I felt it like a shadow that followed me everywhere—in the hot breath of the wind, in sudden whiffs of familiar smells, in the strange silence of the nights. And I tried to fight it, overcome it, tame it—as if one could ever soothe homesickness when home is thousands of miles away.



I tried to recreate even a faint likeness of the world I once knew, as if I could somehow deceive time and distance. It showed in everything—from the carpet patterns in the living room to the copper cookware on the shelves, from silk cushions embroidered with Eastern designs to the atmosphere of the house itself.

But most of all—in the garden.





We planted the garden behind the house, in the lush, slightly headstrong yet warm soil of Houston. We planted roses—crimson, like memories. Grapevines—with delicate tendrils that clung to anything they could reach, as if searching for something of their own. A fig tree, whose broad leaves brought back the quiet courtyard of our Baku home. And, of course, a willow—slender, wind-borne, almost weeping. It stood at the very edge of the yard, as if guarding something sacred, and reminded me of childhood—of how it rustled above our heads at dusk, how we played beneath it, laughed, grew up.



I often went out to it, especially when I was alone. I’d look at its slender branches, bowed to the earth, and in those curves I could read the verses of my past. The willow became a companion and a comfort to me—a tree-messenger from another world.



So it was no surprise that when my mother told me she was coming to visit—for the first time in all those years—I couldn’t hold back my tears. Joy washed over me like a rising tide. I hurried to prepare, doing my best to surround the house with things that might warm her heart: familiar scents, cherished objects, morning tea served in an armudu glass, and even the crispness of freshly baked churek, made from my grandmother’s recipe.



She was to stay with us for several months. And there was something magical about it—as if time had finally taken pity on us and decided to reunite two worlds, two halves of myself.



The long-awaited day arrived. All of us—my husband, our two sons (then still in school), and I—drove to the airport to welcome our dear guest. My heart was pounding with excitement, my thoughts tangled in a whirlwind, and my face was lit with a smile I couldn’t possibly hide.



My mother emerged from the arrivals gate, tired but glowing from within. We rushed to embrace her, and in that hug, it felt like everything dissolved: the years of separation, the miles between us, the aching homesickness. Even the boys, a little shy at first, quickly warmed up, sensing the quiet strength radiating from their grandmother.



It was only later that we noticed how carefully she held a long bundle, wrapped in old cloth. She clutched it as if protecting something fragile and precious. Only once we were in the car, and she had caught her breath a bit, did she reveal her secret.



“It’s a cutting from the pomegranate tree,” she said in a near whisper, as if sharing something sacred. “From our courtyard. It grew tiny roots, and I thought… let it grow here, with you.”



Pomegranate trees are a rarity in Houston. The fruit is sold one by one—and even then, at prices close to gemstones. But for us, it was never just a fruit. It was the taste of childhood, the symbol of our homeland—its color, its juices, its generosity.



As soon as we got home, we carefully unwrapped the bundle. A small sprout, with thin, eager roots reaching for life, was wrapped in a damp cloth. We planted it in a clay pot, placed it where the sun was warmest—and began to wait. It needed time. Time to understand that this was now its home.



My mother cared for it like a child. Every leaf, every small change in its appearance became a source of either worry or joy. If a leaf turned yellow, she shook her head with quiet sorrow. But if a new one appeared, her face lit up—as if it were a holiday.

 then, just before her departure, another small miracle occurred: the tree had taken root. We transplanted it into the garden, placing it in the sunniest spot. I still remember how my mother stood beside it, gently pressing the soil around its base with her hands, as if blessing it for life.



She left. But from that moment on, every phone call began with the same question:



“How’s my little tree? Has it gotten sick? Is it growing?”



And every time we said, “It’s growing, Mama, it’s growing,” there was a short, warm silence on the other end of the line. The kind of pause that could hold an entire homeland.



Everything seemed to be going well—it felt as if fate had granted this little tree a chance: a new land, light, growth.

But then something happened no one could have foreseen. Heavy rains came to Houston. Not the brief, noisy downpours that quickly give way to sunshine, but long, relentless rains, under a low sky that hung heavy over the city.

Day after day, the water fell with stubborn persistence, as if trying to wash something away—erase something from the face of the earth.



Our garden flooded. The soil—dense, clay-heavy, with poor drainage—soaked up water to the brim. Puddles lingered, the earth turned into a thick, sticky mess, and soon we noticed: the pomegranate sapling had begun to wilt. Its leaves, which had so recently reached for the light, drooped, darkened, and began to fall.

We tried to save it—we moved it, drained the soil, sheltered it.

But it was too late. The roots had drowned in the damp.



When we realized the damage was beyond repair, I was overtaken by a hollow ache. As if something vital, fragile, almost sacred had been lost. I couldn’t calm down for days. Regret hung in the air—it was in the morning silence, in the gentle sway of the willow tree, in every glance toward the now-empty space in the garden.



How could it be? How could this happen? The little tree my mother had carried across the ocean, protected through her journey, cradled like a piece of home, like a droplet of memory—was gone.

And with it, something greater than just a plant had vanished. It held the warmth of her hands, her care, her quiet belief that roots could survive even in foreign soil.

Its loss felt like a betrayal of the very order of things.

In our hearts, it was supposed to grow strong, to bloom, to bear fruit—as a sign that love can overcome anything.



We blamed ourselves. Replayed it over and over in our minds—where had we gone wrong? Why had we chosen that exact spot in the garden where water pooled? How had we not foreseen it? Why hadn’t we realized that a foreign tree would need special, delicate care?



And that guilt—not loud, not desperate, but quiet, muffled—settled inside us for a long time. Because the pomegranate tree had come to symbolize something far greater than just the transplanting of a plant. It became a reflection of our own life in a foreign land: the struggle to take root, to find footing, to belong.

And perhaps… the fear of losing what connected us to home.



Some time passed. The loss of the pomegranate sapling still echoed in my heart, but—as it often happens—life gently offered a path to comfort, almost by accident, almost in passing.



One day, we bought apricots at the store. Nothing remarkable, it seemed. But the moment we bit into the first one, we looked at each other: they were extraordinary. Juicy, sweet, with a fragrance that unexpectedly brought back childhood. Apricots like this were almost unheard of here, in Houston.



We finished the apricots, leaving the pits on a plate. One of them caught our eye—smooth, unblemished, as if it held something more within it. And then, almost instinctively, we planted it—not just anywhere, but in the very same clay pot where the pomegranate had once lived. There was still a bit of earth inside, soaked with moisture, time, and perhaps someone’s belief.

We added fresh soil, gently pressed the pit into place, watered it—and began to wait.



And then one day, it sprouted. A slender green shoot, fragile, almost invisible, pushed its way toward the light. We moved it to the windowsill, watched as it grew, reached upward, grew stronger. In the spring, we planted it in the garden. This time, we chose a different spot—sunny, but with good drainage, sheltered, reliable.



The sprout took root. Its leaves grew fuller, sturdier, and before long, that green thread became a true young tree. We watched it with quiet joy, waiting for the first blossoms to appear—and we didn’t hide our hope.



Some of our friends, walking past, would pause and glance at the leaves with curiosity.



“Are you sure that’s an apricot tree?” they asked, doubtfully. “The foliage looks… unusual.”



“Of course it’s an apricot,” we replied with a smile. “We planted the pit ourselves.”



We were certain. We simply wanted to believe that an apricot pit could only grow into an apricot tree. Even if its leaves looked a bit different than the ones in the books. Even if the tree itself remained silent, for now.

We knew: sometimes roots matter more than appearances.

Sometimes—memory is stronger than seed.



Years passed. Quietly—like pollen drifting in the spring air, like morning dew melting on the leaves.

Life followed its course: the children grew, the garden changed, new concerns filled the house.

But one thing remained unchanged—every spring, I would walk into the garden, as if waiting for a miracle.

And then, one spring morning, when the air smelled of damp earth and the sky was as clear as if freshly washed, I stepped into the yard… and suddenly stopped.

Right there, among the green leaves of the apricot tree, bloomed three tiny scarlet flowers. I leaned in closer—and froze.

They were not apricot blossoms.

They were pomegranate flowers.



“Oh my God!” I breathed out.



My heart pounded so fiercely that I sat down right on the bench beneath the willow. It felt as if the world had hushed, listening to my silence. Those three flowers—like three sparks from the past. Like a greeting sent through time.



I immediately called my husband. He was surprised, laughed, rejoiced—the way grown-ups do when, for a moment, they are allowed to become children again.

And when we told my mother, her voice on the other end of the line trembled. Words failed her—only sighs, laughter, and tears mingled together.



Later, once the excitement had settled, we understood everything.

When we transplanted the pomegranate sapling, a tiny fragment of its root had remained in the pot.

And when we planted the apricot pit there, what sprouted was not an apricot at all.

What grew was the pomegranate.

The very same one we had mourned, buried in the soggy earth, the one we had thought was lost forever.



And later still, in an article about botany, I read something remarkable: the pomegranate tree has a special trait—“insomnia.” If its stem and branches get buried under sand or soil, the plant does not die. It grows new roots. It is reborn.



I read that phrase over and over. And I realized: this is not just a botanical fact. It is a symbol. The pomegranate, like a mother’s love, never fades. It never gives up. Even if buried, forgotten, abandoned—it will find a way. It will pierce through the darkness, push aside the stones, and take root again.



This tree became for me the embodiment of my mother’s gift—not merely a plant, but a part of her. A piece of her love, her patience, her silent strength.

Now, every time I pass by the tree, I stop, touch its branches—and give thanks. For life. For roots. For the miracle that even in foreign soil, wonders are possible.



My mother’s pomegranate tree lives on. For over twenty years now, it has blossomed in our Houston garden—lush, generous, with that special Eastern grandeur that can never be mistaken for anything else. Its flowers shine like little flames, and its fruit—like rubies filled with sunlight and silence.

Every autumn, it is covered with pomegranates. We gather them with reverence, as if receiving gifts not just from a tree—but from life itself, from a love that knows no distance, no rain, no passing years.



Some of these fruits we carefully preserve—keeping them until the end of December. And it has become a tradition: on our New Year’s table, among the festive dishes and sparkling lights, there is always one or two pomegranates. Beautiful, heavy, with smooth skin like a lacquered box.



Cut open one of these—and inside lies a treasure. Hundreds, thousands of ruby-red seeds, like precious gems. Each one feels like a small memory, a promise, a blessing. You take a handful and realize—this is not just a fruit. This is home. This is mother. This is memory that cannot be drowned in any water, buried in the soil, or erased from the face of time.



Sometimes I feel that every single seed is a word once left unspoken but deeply lived. Each one is like a gentle glance, a warm hand, the breath of the homeland. And as we sit at the festive table, breaking open these pomegranates, in a way, we return to the place where it all began.

To the place where it still lives.
