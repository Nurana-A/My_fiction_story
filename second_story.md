# Charades



Summer was drawing to a close. Narmina had finished fourth grade, and instead of joy, a dull fear gripped her — school was starting soon. All her anxiety narrowed down to one thing: they were getting a new math teacher. Instead of the kind and fair Valentina Dmitrievna, someone else was coming. Liliya Samoylovna.

There were real legends about her. The strictest, the most uncompromising of all. But the scariest part was that Liliya Samoylovna reminded Narmina of the babai ( babayka)* from her childhood nightmares — the one who used to chase her through the twisting corridors of dreams, trying to grab her with long, hooked fingers. Luckily, the creature never succeeded — Narmina always woke up just in time, saved by the alarm clock or a sudden shout from outside.

The dreams had long since left her alone, but the new teacher seemed to pull them back from the darkness and oblivion. What if the babai had decided to escape the dream and step into reality? Returned — but now in the form of an adult woman with a grade book under her arm and a student’s journal in her hands? What if she came back for revenge — as a teacher, punishing children with bad marks?

Tall and bony, with slumped shoulders and bulging eyes that seemed to be always on the lookout for the weak. A long nose, lips like threads. Gold crowns flashed in her mouth — not so much in a smile as in a grimace. And her hairstyle — a tight ponytail — didn’t look like a teacher’s hairstyle at all. To Narmina, it looked like a witch’s broom.

“Do normal teachers wear their hair in a ponytail?” she wondered. “No — only babais do.”

Ilgar, her younger brother, had seen the babai too — all bones and with that same witchy hair. His only shield was their mother’s warmth: once he gripped her hand, sleep came without fear. Her fingers were his talisman, his magical charm, his shield against the night creatures.

Narmina thought about the new teacher all summer. The thought gnawed at her from the inside. But there was another fear too: starting in September, they would be learning not just math, but algebra and geometry. Geometry had the reputation of being the hardest of all subjects. Even under the guidance of the very human Valentina Dmitrievna, she had barely managed to get a B. And now — geometry, algebra, and… the babai.

She spent the whole summer alone with Ilgar. He was starting first grade that fall. Their parents left early each morning for work. The yard outside buzzed with laughter and games, but they were strictly forbidden from going out without adults. Fortunately, Ilgar didn’t know how to open the door by himself — the only thing keeping him from escaping to where balls bounced, swings creaked, and noisy neighborhood kids roamed.

When he started whining at the door again, clearly bored out of his mind, Narmina realized — persuasion no longer worked. That’s when she turned to her greatest weapon: imagination.

She became Pippi Longstocking. Fearless, inventive, independent. But Pippi had friends. Narmina had only her younger brother — and a locked door.

So she decided: why not call in help from their favorite movie heroes?

“You know,” she said to Ilgar, squinting mysteriously, “all our heroes came to me in a dream. We had the most incredible adventures together…”

Ilgar immediately let go of the door handle. His eyes went wide — like a hero’s at the very start of a magic tale.

“What happened?” he whispered. “Tell me!”

Something clicked inside Narmina. She felt like a real storyteller — she realized her inner Scheherazade had awakened. Her imagination flared up like fireworks. She began to tell the story — confidently, with excitement, as if she’d lived it all herself: how they caught spies, crossed raging rivers, saved people in danger, and rescued prisoners from dragon-guarded castles.

Every evening brought a new tale — full of wonder, danger, bravery, and, of course, triumph.

The story always ended at the most thrilling moment — just as their parents walked through the door. It became their little ritual. In the morning, Ilgar would stay home without protest, as long as his sister promised to continue the tale later. And in the evening — when their mother and father returned — the two of them would rush out into the yard, and the real day would be completed with play, in the wind, among the poplars and the voices.

The courtyard where Narmina lived was like a miniature country — diverse, colorful, full of noise. Toddlers and teenagers played side by side, while older kids sat on benches, discussing their own important matters. Sometimes the entire yard came together — for games like broken telephone, riddles, or movie guessing.

But Narmina’s favorite was charades.

Charades wasn’t just a game — it felt like a secret ritual. It was magic. Here, knowledge and logic were only part of the skill; what truly mattered was intuition — the ability to read hints and faces. Everything depended on subtlety, fleeting glances, clues too delicate to speak aloud. One person would pick a name — someone real, from the yard — and the others asked questions, inching forward through the fog of their own guesses.

The ones who won were the ones who could feel — delicately, almost magically.

That evening the yard was buzzing — like a beehive before a storm. Almost everyone had gathered in a circle drawn on the pavement: the younger ones, the teenagers, even the “grown-ups” who were barely fifteen. Beyond the flowerbeds, the windows glowed. From balconies, some watched, pretending they were just drinking tea.

Ilgar tugged on Narmina’s hand.

“Can we play together?.. I want to be on her team!” His voice was firm, and to everyone’s surprise, no one objected. A little kid was a little kid — no one wanted to hurt his feelings. Let him guess with his sister.

The first rounds were easy: a boy with a rooster-like shock of red hair — guessed from his cap; a girl who always spun in front of mirrors — identified by her perfume. Everyone laughed, exchanged knowing glances, pretended they had figured it out from the start.

Narmina was drawn in without even noticing — her tension melted away, the game pulling her in like a tide.

Then it was Shamil’s turn. He was fourteen, wore shirts untucked, and knew how to handle a soccer ball.

He didn’t immediately choose a name. The game was reaching its peak — everyone expected something clever, tricky, surprising. He hesitated, his eyes slowly scanning the familiar faces: laughing, teasing, guarded.

He narrowed his eyes, as if looking not into the yard but toward someone far away, and said slowly — almost in a whisper, but loud enough for all to hear:

“She… is very beautiful.”

The yard fell silent.

The hush slid down from the balconies, rolled off the swings, and hung in the air between heads. Even the sparrows on the wires seemed to freeze.

Everyone thought the same thing without saying a word: Rena.

Who else could it be?

Rena — slender, graceful, self-assured.

It was like someone had switched on the same slide in every mind: Rena.

Of course it was her. She moved like a waltz, smiled with a hint of spice, and carried enough confidence for everyone. Even those who envied her admitted — she was the prettiest girl around. It was too obvious.

But before anyone could joke or sigh, smirk or blurt out a name, Ilgar’s voice — bright, sincere, almost childlike — cut through the silence like a bell:

“But it’s so easy! Of course it’s Narmina! She’s not just beautiful — she’s the smartest! Everybody knows that! I guessed right, didn’t I?”

“It’s Narmina! Of course it’s Narmina!”

His voice rang out — so delighted, so full of light, as if he were naming an undeniable truth.

At first, she didn’t even realize he was talking about her.

Her cheeks flared — as if betraying her. No, no, I’m not ready for this kind of attention. I don’t know how to carry it.

Of course he doesn’t mean her. It’s Rena, obviously. Even if no one says it, everyone’s thinking it.

Narmina was thinking it too.

Narmina felt the whole world pause: the swings, the voices, even breath itself. Heat rose to her face — not from the sun, but from something more dangerous, more frightening, and somehow sweet.

Beautiful? The smartest? In front of everyone?

She had never thought anyone would guess her.

Never imagined anyone would even think of her like that — beautiful.

She had her own battles with the mirror. Her cheeks seemed too round, her hair too unruly. The freckle on her nose annoyed her, and so did the way she blushed too quickly. Sometimes she felt made entirely of “not quite”: not quite the right laugh, the right walk, the right look.

She wanted to sink through the asphalt, vanish into the flowerbed.

But her eyes lifted — on their own — and met Shamil’s.

He was looking at her. Calmly. Seriously.

As if he understood something about her she hadn’t yet understood herself.

He seemed ready to speak — to say something — when Ilgar appeared beside him, gazing up with such admiration, with such unshakable faith in his sister, that Shamil suddenly realized:

he had no right to break that feeling.

Even if someone else might think differently.

Even if Rena — yes, Rena, like from a magazine cover — was the more obvious answer.

But that didn’t matter now.

Some things are more important than objective beauty.

And more important than the truth — if that truth might hurt someone.

Because life isn’t about honesty. Life is about love.

It wasn’t a revelation — not a sudden flash — but a quiet, warm knowing that had been slowly growing inside him.

He simply understood: honesty without love is empty.

Truthful words don’t warm anyone if they lack heart.

And even the noblest actions mean nothing if they carry no soul.

Shamil believed — truly believed — that love mattered more than honesty.

Because love forgives what truth can’t explain.

Because it stays when everything else falls apart.

Because only in love do we become fully ourselves.

He remembered how he used to act — always right, always fair, always proper.

He had often put principle above feeling, word above glance, duty above desire.

He thought that was how it should be: to live rightly, to live truthfully.

But now, something had changed.

He understood: life — it turns out — isn’t about honesty.

Not only.

Life is about love.

He sighed and closed his eyes.

Perhaps for the first time in a long while, he allowed himself to simply feel.

And his heart answered.

It wasn’t truth, nor justice, but love that made them alive.

He spoke the way he believed —

Because now he knew: being honest was right.

But to love — was to live.

And so, looking Ilgar straight in the eye, he said:

“You guessed it. It’s your sister. Your sister… she’s the most beautiful.”

Seriously. Without irony.

Composed, grown-up — as if he weren’t just confirming an answer, but affirming a value.

As if he was giving everyone permission to believe in something no one had dared to see before. 

And in that instant, the courtyard shifted.

Someone blinked. Someone looked away. But no one laughed.

No one said, “Come on, really?”

Because in those words — she’s the most beautiful and the smartest — there was no pretense.

They were spoken with such sincerity that contradicting them would’ve felt cruel.

And everyone accepted it.

The world, for a moment, turned itself inside out.

The kind of moment when something true and unexpected is finally recognized.

The kind of beauty people overlook — not because it’s missing, but because they never looked deep enough.

The world turned inside out.

Silence settled.

Narmina felt awkward.

She had never thought of herself like that.

Sure, her mother always told her she was special — beautiful and smart — but that’s what all mothers say about their children.

But this — this was a challenge thrown at the whole courtyard.

And it came from her little brother.

Narmina was stunned.

It felt like a real victory — and it was Ilgar who had placed it into her hands.

She didn’t remember how the game ended.

Everything dissolved into golden sunlight, voices, the rustling of leaves.

She walked home, holding her brother’s hand, a little faster than usual — as if afraid someone would call out and ask her what she was feeling.

And she wouldn’t have known what to say.

The house was dim.

Sunlight lay in stripes across the floor. Ilgar started babbling to his mother as soon as she opened the door.

She slipped off her sandals, stepped into the room, and sat on the edge of the bed.

There was warmth in her chest — not heat, not nervousness, but a steady glow, as if a small lantern had been lit inside her.

She thought of Ilgar — his shining eyes, the triumphant voice.

Of Shamil — his calm “You guessed it.”

She stood, walked to the mirror, and turned from side to side — as if looking at herself for the first time.

In the mirror, she no longer saw a familiar reflection.

She was searching for something — not a face, but a riddle.

The same face as always — familiar, dear.

But now she was looking for traces of someone else’s words in it.

Why? She didn’t know.

She had simply asked herself — for the first time: What am I really like?

As if the charades were no longer about someone else —

but about her.

Her thoughts skipped suddenly to Lidiya Samoylovna.

And cautiously, Narmina allowed a thought to slip through: what if she wasn’t as scary as she had seemed all summer?

And then she gasped — startled by herself.

How could she? Could a babai ever be kind or beautiful?

She tried to swat that doubt away — like a persistent fly —

but it stayed.

Quiet but steady, like a drop of water under her collar.

Something had shifted. After that game, after her brother called her beautiful and smart, Narmina began to see herself differently. As if, for the first time, she allowed herself to be not just modest and obedient, but strong, brave. Even grown-up. Not like Mama—but like Pippi. Like a girl with a steel wire of confidence inside.

She caught herself thinking: after yesterday’s game, she somehow felt more sure of herself. More than that—less afraid of the upcoming lessons with the new math teacher.

The last week before school flew by in a flurry of errands with Mama—shopping for notebooks, pencils, a pencil case.

On the first of September, Narmina woke up early—even before her alarm. Outside, the warm morning darkness still lingered, and the air smelled different than it did in summer—like textbooks, ink, and wet asphalt. Her chest ached—not from fear, but from tension. From anticipation.

Her school uniform had been laid out the night before: a white shirt with a collar, a gray skirt, Velcro shoes. Everything was neatly placed on the back of a chair. She dressed slowly, like performing a ritual, listening closely to every movement. Today, everything had to be perfect.

Mama braided her hair carefully, adjusted her collar. Her expression was a little anxious, but kind. Her father said he could barely recognize her—she looked so grown up. Narmina smiled slightly but said nothing. Inside, a quiet certainty was growing: something important was about to happen.

And finally, the long-awaited first geometry lesson began.

The classroom was buzzing when the bell rang. A few moments later, Lidiya Samoylovna walked in with the grade book in her hands. Her stern gaze swept the class, and her expression grew even more severe. Narmina’s hands trembled, but she quickly reminded herself that she was trying not to judge by appearances anymore.

The room went silent, and the teacher began to go over the roster. When she read Narmina’s name, Narmina stood up. The math teacher nodded and said:

“Ok, girl.”

Narmina was surprised—she called many of them that. The word “girl” sounded vague and cold. It stirred something inside her, but she quickly brushed it away.

The lesson began with a surprise. Instead of diving straight into numbers and theorems, Lidiya Samoylovna drew a large, perfect triangle on the board and asked:

“What’s special about it?”

Silence. Narmina suddenly felt something stir inside her—not fear, but curiosity. She stared at the white lines as if trying to decipher a riddle. Her hand twitched—she wanted to raise it, but didn’t dare.

“All the sides are the same length,” said Ira cautiously from the first row.

“Correct,” Lidiya Samoylovna nodded. “And the angles?”

“They’re all the same!” someone shouted from the back.

“So this triangle has symmetry. Beauty. Order,” Lidiya Samoylovna said softly, almost in a whisper. Then she added, “Geometry isn’t just about shapes. It’s about how the world is built.”

From the very first moments, Narmina realized: this was not what she had expected. Lidiya Samoylovna spoke calmly, without pressure, but with such quiet authority that even the air in the room seemed to listen. Her voice wasn’t strict to inspire fear, nor falsely sweet. It simply held certainty.

“Geometry,” she said, turning back to the board, “isn’t only about lines and figures. It’s about thinking. About seeing the invisible.”

Narmina stared at the triangle without blinking. It began to glow with its own logic. Those even lines, those angles—they suddenly seemed steady and dependable. As if in that triangle, there could be no deception, no surprise.

She felt the tension that had been building all morning begin to ease. Her hands stopped trembling.

At first, Narmina was cautious. Then she caught herself—she was… interested. Not because she had to be, not because she wanted a good grade—but truly interested.

She raised her hand. She listened. She took notes eagerly, as if Lidiya Samoylovna’s words were unlocking secret doors.

“If everything in the world could be explained with triangles like this,” she thought, “maybe growing up isn’t so scary after all.”

Lidiya Samoylovna continued explaining, and Narmina suddenly noticed: her voice didn’t have that icy strictness she had imagined all summer. It was steady, clear, but not frightening. Not a single word was wasted.

After the break, the classroom held a quiet fatigue—as if with geometry, each student had slightly shifted their inner angle of vision. Narmina sat at her desk again, but differently: sitting straight, notebook open, eyes bright.

Lidiya Samoylovna walked between the rows, glancing at their work, saying nothing. Then she stopped by Narmina’s desk, looked at the carefully drawn shapes, and said softly:

“You’re doing well.”

It sounded simple, without any excess drama. But Narmina felt something thaw inside her. The words sank deep—into the place where fear, doubt, and those babai fantasies still lingered. They remained there—but now, they were pushed to the side.

When the bell rang, the children began to chatter and shuffle their chairs. Narmina slowly closed her notebook. Before leaving, she glanced once more at Lidiya Samoylovna. The teacher stood by the window, adjusting the curtains. And then—almost imperceptibly—she smiled.

For the first time in a long while, Narmina felt: she would manage.

Walking home from school, she floated as if on clouds. Thoughts hummed in her mind: Everything in the world is relative… Just yesterday she had been certain there was nothing more boring than geometry. And today… everything had changed.

September sunshine filled the streets. Leaves had begun to yellow at their edges, but the air was still warm. Narmina strolled home slowly, feeling that lesson still echo in her soul.

The world around felt transformed: sharper, clearer—as if someone had wiped away a foggy pane.

She thought: perhaps… even a babai can be kind sometimes. Only we don’t know how to look at them properly when we’re small. And sometimes—to see it—we have to grow. Just a little.

At home, everything was as usual: Mama cooking dinner, Papa reading the newspaper, her brother spilling water on the floor and asking for food every fifteen minutes. But Narmina saw it all differently—almost through glass. Not detached—on the contrary: clear, warm, with understanding.

At dinner, she spoke about the lesson for the first time on her own.

“We had geometry today,” she said.

Mama turned from the kitchen.

“And how was it?”

Narmina shrugged, as if it didn’t matter. But her eyes sparkled.

“I liked it. It was interesting.”

She hurriedly described the new teacher and the triangle.

Her brother stared at her as if she were some cosmic oddity:

“You, what—have you fallen in love with triangles?”

She smirked. Didn’t answer. Just finished her soup and went to her room.

At home, Narmina ate quickly and picked up her geometry textbook. At first she flipped through the pages, then decided to study the first lessons more carefully and try one exercise. After a few attempts, she not only solved the problem but became so engrossed she eagerly moved on to the next examples.

Her hands turned pages, searched for familiar words, drew line segments. She didn’t even notice how time passed. Inside, there lived a strange but pleasant thrill—as if something inside had woken up. Something that was truly hers.

That night, already lying in bed, she mentally revisited the class. How Lidiya Samoylovna held the chalk. How she drew lines. How she said: “To see is not the same as to look.” Narmina repeated that phrase to herself like a spell.

She stared at the ceiling. Then closed her eyes.

No, Lidiya Samoylovna is not a babai. Babais don’t look at you calmly. Don’t notice how you write. Don’t make you feel important.

And most importantly—babais don’t open up the world to you.

When she fell asleep, she dreamed of triangles floating in the sky like kites. Beneath them stood her—with a notebook, an open face, and unexpected confidence.

And she was not afraid. Not at all.

The next day brought an algebra lesson. And here, Lidiya Samoylovna showed a new approach.

After the break, Lidiya Samoylovna re-entered the classroom—this time with a different textbook and a slightly different energy—as if shifting into a new tone. She didn’t like theatrics and never made grand introductions, but each of her lessons began like a small performance—minus the applause.

She entered not with her usual dry strictness, but with a strange sparkle in her eyes, as though she carried a secret she was ready to share.

“Today,” she said, placing a neat pile of notebooks on the desk, “we will journey together. To the land of equations and the unknown. Who’s ready for an adventure?”

The class stirred. Narmina, sitting by the window, straightened.

“Open your notebooks. Algebra,” she said. “Topic: expressions, variables, equations.”

The words sounded to Narmina like a spell. Still new, a bit scary. But—not hostile. She watched intently as Lidiya Samoylovna wrote an equation on the board, chalk squeaking, one line transforming into another.

x + 3 = 7

“What do we know?” asked the teacher. “What are we looking for?”

Silence. Then someone murmured:

“We’re looking for x…”

“We are not looking for x,” she gently corrected. “We’re looking for meaning. Algebra isn’t about guessing, it’s about understanding.”

Narmina leaned toward her notebook again. Her hand instinctively mirrored the teacher’s motion. A line appeared on paper—and something clicked in her mind. She realized: there is order here. There is a path.

Algebra turned out to be not a set of boring rules, as it had seemed before—but something like a game. But not a guessing game—a logic chain where you shape the meaning yourself.

Suddenly, a spark of excitement lit inside her: she didn’t just want to solve the equation—she wanted to understand why it worked. What for. Where that “x” came from. Why an equation could be simplified, and what it means to move something to the other side with a minus sign.

Lidiya Samoylovna paced calmly through the classroom and, without raising her voice, said:

“Solving equations is like untying a knot. Sometimes you need to tug gently, sometimes let go. Don’t rip it—think.”

But she continued like that. She drew on the board, not simply explaining rules, but composing a puzzle. Instead of a monotonous dictation, there was intrigue:

“What happens if we move this term across the equals sign? Who dares to guess?”

Narmina caught herself—not just listening—but interested. She suddenly felt she could grasp this system, those symbols that had once felt alien and off-putting. They arranged into a clear, almost musical structure. She was drawn into the game.

When the bell rang, the students sprang up noisily. But Narmina remained seated for another second. She could feel her brain breathing. As if a window had opened in her mind—and fresh air had rushed in.

Algebra wasn’t scary. It was peculiar—but logical. And if geometry had given her a sense of form, algebra gave her a sense of meaning.

She couldn’t explain it. But she knew: tonight she would open her textbook again at home. Not because she had to, but because she truly wanted to.

Suddenly, Narmina felt a surge of excitement: she no longer merely wanted to solve the equations—she wanted to understand why. What for? Where does this “x” come from? Why can an equation be simplified, and what does it mean to “move something across the equals sign with a minus”?

Lidiya Samoylovna paced through the classroom, speaking softly but steadily:

“Solving an equation is like undoing a knot. Sometimes you need to pull gently, sometimes you need to release. Don’t rip it—think.”

And she continued in the same spirit—sketching on the board, not just explaining rules but composing a kind of mystery. Instead of monotonous instruction, there was intrigue:

“What happens if you move this term across the equality sign? Who dares guess?”

Narmina realized she wasn’t just listening—she was genuinely interested. She suddenly felt she could understand the system, these symbols that once seemed foreign and discouraging. They formed into a clear, almost musical structure. She was drawn into the game.

When the bell rang, the students rose noisily. But Narmina remained seated for a moment longer. She could feel her mind breathing—as if windows had opened inside, and fresh air rushed in.

On the walk home, the equation echoed in her mind. Strange—but it sounded like music in her head. There was something harmonious, symmetrical about it—like rhyme or rhythm.

She suddenly understood that no matter what she becomes—mathematician, artist, or writer—the important thing was that now she knows: she can think. She can cope. She can stand up and speak.

As Narmina walked home, two textbooks—algebra and geometry—gently creaked in her backpack. And a single thought spun through her mind: “Maybe everything really does depend on how you look at it?”

Subjects had captured her interest so much that she began not only doing homework, but racing ahead to study the next assignments.

Classes continued every day as usual—on schedule, by the bell, by the rules. But for Narmina, they had become entirely different. Now she didn’t just sit in class staring out the window or doodling in her notebook. She caught every word. She tried to understand—not out of obligation, but real curiosity. Suddenly everything began to form a pattern—line segments, angles, parallel lines, triangles of different sides. As though something important had been revealed in that strange, exacting world of geometry: clarity, logic, order.

She came to class with assignments done and real questions—questions her own, not borrowed. She raised her hand, explained answers at the board, sometimes even argued—courteously, but with passion. At first, Lidiya Samoylovna was surprised—but she soon nodded approvingly. She began to look at Narmina differently. Not as a quiet, dreamy girl with fantasies, but as a thoughtful, bright student worthy of praise—out loud. And she praised her. Once even asking Narmina to show the entire class how she solved a difficult problem. Narmina’s hands shook—but she did it. And it felt like a stage debut, a small victory.

After class, Lidiya Samoylovna came over to her.

“Narmina,” she said softly but clearly, “you worked with real fire today. Keep it up.”

It wasn’t just a compliment—it was a small, quiet recognition. And recognition from her, from Lidiya Samoylovna, somehow warmed Narmina.

From that moment, everything seemed to shift. Some girls began glancing at her with surprise; others with a subtle, childish envy. Especially those who had once seen themselves as “stars” of the lesson. Some whispered behind her back, others echoed her answers. Once someone even tried to taunt her:

“Look who’s smart now… yesterday you didn’t even know which side of a triangle is the hypotenuse!”

But Narmina didn’t react as sharply anymore. A new feeling seemed to protect her—confidence that doesn’t shout, but simply is. And Lidiya Samoylovna more often addressed her by name, sometimes even with a faint smile—not at all witchy. And there was something magical in that—a slight shift in the world, where what once terrified became familiar.

Finally, near the end of the term, came the day of the unified algebra and geometry exams.

That morning, an unusual silence filled the classroom—only found before something serious. Even the most talkative students were quiet or whispering, flipping through their notebooks one last time. Narmina arrived at school earlier than usual. In her stomach was a familiar sensation—not fear, but a gentle tension, like moments before stepping onto a stage. She tried to hide her nerves, though her fingers felt slightly cold.

Lidiya Samoylovna walked into the room with a neat stack of printed pages and her strict teacher-face firmly in place.

“Today’s test follows the rules,” she announced. “No talking. Copying is useless—each of you has a different version.” She dealt out the sheets like playing cards.

When Narmina saw her set of problems, her heart beat faster—but not with the old dread. It was a bright jolt of energy: she knew what to do. Everything was familiar, everything in its place—angles, formulas, proofs. She settled down and wrote with quiet confidence, even pleasure, as though she were tackling an intriguing puzzle rather than a test.

The classroom sank into silence. Compasses, rulers, pencils and erasers lay ready on every desk. The paper rustled like a bird’s wings. Narmina realised she wasn’t afraid. Nervous, yes—but the clean, steady kind, like standing on a high diving board and seeing the whole landscape below.

Problem 1: construct a triangle from three given sides and draw a median.

Problem 2: prove that corresponding angles are equal for two parallel lines cut by a transversal.

I can do this, she thought, and began. The compass point bit the paper surely, lines fell into place. She felt less like a pupil than a painter unafraid to mark the page because she knew exactly what she was drawing.

While she wrote out her proofs she heard the teacher’s voice in her head:

“Don’t be afraid to use words. Every thought must be justified. Don’t guess—reason.”

So she reasoned—calmly, without haste—like a fairy-tale heroine who must explain each step: “Because this is a base angle,” “Because the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°.”

When she handed in her paper she realised: for the first time, geometry had been not a battle but a dialogue—logical, elegant, almost personal.

Algebra followed. That sheet felt even friendlier. One question had a twist, but she simply left it till last, then came back and solved it.

When the bell rang she submitted her work quietly. She didn’t need to peek at anyone else’s answers, didn’t dash out praying she’d scraped through. She knew she’d done well, and that quiet, private knowledge was the sweetest part of the day.

The next three days were an ache of suspense. Outwardly Narmina behaved as usual—classes, notes, hallway smiles—but inside she replayed the tests, hunting for mistakes, especially in algebra. Geometry she felt in her bones; algebra still held a couple of doubtful spots.

On the third morning Lidiya Samoylovna entered, set a stack of marked papers on her desk, lifted her eyes and said:

“I’ll announce the results now. If you have questions, see me afterwards.”

Narmina’s heart dropped.

The teacher’s voice softened fractionally in Narmina’s direction.

“Overall—quite good, but you are sometimes careless. Geometry doesn’t forgive errors; it demands precision.”

She paused.

“We have one ‘A’. The only one in the class. Narmina—well done.”

A brief, ringing silence. Heads turned, eyebrows rose, a few mouths stayed shut—but this was her moment. Not loud, not showy, but real. She lowered her gaze and felt something unfold inside her, a part that had always hidden and doubted.

The notebook reached her desk: a perfect 5, underlined firmly but without anger.

Next lesson: algebra. The atmosphere was tenser. The teacher reshuffled the scripts as though checking them a second time.

“Algebra is more capricious,” she said. “It’s not enough to solve—you must show how you think. Many of you found the right answer but didn’t explain the path. Mathematics likes to be spoken to.”

Grades spread across the room—some Cs, plenty of Bs. When she reached Narmina she looked straight at her:

“Neat work, clear steps. But there’s a slip in the system problem. A 4. You worked hard—keep at it.”

Inside Narmina felt a wave of relief. A four wasn’t bad—especially now. She opened the notebook: the first two problems flawless; in the system of equations she’d written +2 instead of −2, dragging the result down.

Once she would have been crushed, maybe even cried into her schoolbag. Now she simply nodded to herself. Yes, it stings—but she understands. Growth is seeing the mistake and not fearing it.

At home, she didn’t tell anyone right away. She wanted to hold on to that feeling just a little longer — like a small secret, like a candy in her pocket she hadn’t unwrapped yet, but was already happy to have.

Her mother came back from work, tired and in a rush:

— So? How was your day? Got much homework?

Narmina shrugged.

— The usual. Just got our test results back.

Her mother tensed up instantly — in her voice, her face, her gesture, as if bracing for bad news.

— And?

— Got a four in algebra.

— Oh, thank God, — her mother exhaled. — I thought you’d gotten completely lost in it.

Narmina smiled faintly and added, almost casually:

— And in geometry — a five. The only one in the class.

Her mother paused mid-motion. She looked at her — carefully, a little disbelieving.

— Really? The only one?

— Mhm, — Narmina nodded, and for the first time she said it not as something strange or miraculous, but as something real. Something possible.

Her mother stepped closer, placed a hand on her daughter’s shoulder.

— You’re my smart girl. See? You can do it when you try.

And there was no surprise in her voice anymore — only pride, and warm recognition. Narmina nodded silently, but inside, something lit up: not just I can — I did.

From the other room, her brother had overheard and peeked in, frowning thoughtfully:

— So… is a five a lot?

Narmina snorted and tossed a pillow at him — playfully, like a friend.

— A lot! Especially when you used to think it wasn’t meant for you at all.

He didn’t get it, but he laughed. And she went to her room, sat at her desk, and opened her physics notebook. Not because she had to — but because now she was curious: could she do this too?

And it felt like she could. Very much so.

That’s how, by the end of the year, she became an honor student.

Spring came suddenly, as it always does. The melting snow revealed wet pavement, and the smell of damp earth drifted through school hallways, mixing with chalk and ink. Narmina was coming home with another quarter report card — neat and balanced like a math equation: five, five, five, four, five…

But something had changed. She still wasn’t used to those fives — they didn’t just appear on paper, but somewhere deep inside. Not as rewards, but as proof: she could.

She simply felt it — she had grown. She was no longer the girl who hid behind her desk, afraid of strange voices and difficult lessons.

Now she was someone who could think, listen, solve, stumble — and get up again.

Caught up in her studies, she didn’t even notice the school year coming to an end. The last day arrived. On her way home, she ran into Lidiya Samoylovna. They started talking, and the teacher said she wouldn’t be teaching their class anymore — due to family reasons, she was transferring to another school closer to home.

Narmina felt a pang of sadness. She walked alongside her in silence, not knowing what to say. And then Lidiya Samoylovna looked at her and smiled — simply, warmly. And in that moment, Narmina suddenly saw how beautiful she was. Not strict, not scary — just real. With clear eyes and kind creases at the corners.

But now that everything had changed, she remembered: in fairy tales, beautiful women are often witches, and those who frighten you at first turn out to be the kindest. Real kindness doesn’t always smile from the first page.

And so she stood beside Lidiya Samoylovna, listening to her parting words, watching her smile — a true, open smile. And in that smile, where a few golden teeth gleamed, there was so much warmth and strength that Narmina suddenly understood: beauty is a relative thing. A smile can be more beautiful than a face, and a person — kinder than you ever expected.

Lidiya Samoylovna was no longer a babai, a monster. She was a teacher — the one who had believed in her first. Or maybe even a good fairy — only Narmina had noticed it too late.

And suddenly, everything made sense. The teacher who once seemed frightening turned out to be one of the kindest people she had ever known. Even though she would no longer teach them, in Narmina’s memory she would remain — forever. As someone who had taught her not just geometry, but how to believe in herself.

Narmina realized: beauty isn’t what the eyes see — it’s what the heart recognizes.

In that moment, it became clear: beauty isn’t about shape or shine — it’s about the feeling someone gives you when they look at you, when they smile.

Beauty, she learned, wasn’t always smooth or perfect. Sometimes, it hid in the crinkles around the eyes, in the golden glint of a tooth, in the warmth of a glance.

She understood now — beauty is a shifting thing. One day you don’t notice it; the next, you can’t look away.

She remembered: in stories, beauties often turn out to be witches — with cold smiles and prickly hearts. But here, it was the other way around — the kindest fairy had hidden behind the image of a “babai.”

And there, for the first time, Narmina thought: maybe true beauty isn’t appearance at all. Maybe it’s the way someone looks at you and smiles.

They parted at the crossroads. Lidiya Samoylovna went one way, Narmina the other. She walked slowly, not in a hurry, as if wanting to stretch this day just a little longer.

The sun was already leaning toward the horizon, long shadows stretched across the asphalt, and the air was filled with the scent of summer — not quite vacation yet, but no longer school. In her backpack, she carried notebooks and a report card full of fives — but the most important thing was inside. Something new, bright, and slightly aching.

The wind carried the scent of hot asphalt and blooming acacia. She walked home — to her room, to summer, to new books, to dreams that now felt a little closer. And with her walked a quiet feeling: it was all just beginning.

Only in summer, when the school went quiet and the mornings no longer rang with an alarm clock, did Narmina suddenly realize — she had changed. Not because she’d become a top student or could solve problems, but because something inside her had become calmer, clearer. As if a quiet strength had appeared — one that didn’t depend on grades or others’ opinions.

That strength hadn’t come out of nowhere. It was woven from two threads — a brother’s love and a teacher’s belief.

Her little brother, defenseless and earnest, had always looked at her as if she were magic. He didn’t know fear, didn’t understand doubt — he just missed her when she was sad and called her to play. He believed in her — simply because she was his sister.

And Lidiya Samoylovna… first strict, almost frightening — had turned out to be someone who saw something important in her. She didn’t coddle or encourage — she just waited. Trusted that Narmina would manage. And Narmina did. First — out of fear. Then — out of respect. And finally — because she realized: she could.

Now she was walking home along the damp walls after the rain, listening to how the school voices were fading. This year had been a charade — and she had been the one solving it. Herself, the people, the numbers, the fears. And it seemed she had found the answer.

In the distance, the lights of their building twinkled. Summer was beginning.

And no more riddles could frighten her



In Slavic folklore, “Babai” (or “Babayka,” “Babayko,” or “Bebok”) is a night spirit or bogeyman used to frighten children into behaving.
He is said to abduct children who don’t sleep at night or misbehave.
